# A-Learning-to-Rank-Model-for-E-Commerce-Search
The goal of this project is to build a Learning to Rank (LTR) model to improve the relevance of search results on an e-commerce platform. The task involved working with two datasets: one containing product and query interactions and another detailing user behavior on the platform.
## Key Tasks:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing exploratory data analysis to identify outliers and trends.
- **Feature Engineering:** Developed meaningful features from product attributes (e.g., price, discount) and user behavior data (e.g., clicks, sales) to enhance model performance.
  
- **Model Building:** Built and trained a machine learning ranking model (XGBRanker) to predict the relevance of products for given search queries.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the model using ranking metrics such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Precision.
  
- **Model Optimization:** Fine-tuned model hyperparameters to maximize performance, with a focus on generalization to unseen data.
  
- **Model Performance:** Achieved competitive ranking performance using the selected model and optimization strategies, with detailed evaluation metrics.
